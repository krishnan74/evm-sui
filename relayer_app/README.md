# SwapYourSuiii - Cross-Chain EVM ‚Üî SUI Swaps

A modern, decentralized application for cross-chain token swaps between Ethereum and Sui networks using 1inch SDK and custom escrow contracts.

## üöÄ Features

- **Cross-Chain Swaps**: Seamlessly swap tokens between Ethereum and Sui networks
- **Secure Escrow**: Your funds are protected by smart contract escrow

## How it's Made
This project was built by integrating both EVM and Sui smart contract ecosystems to enable atomic swaps via HTLCs (Hashed Timelock Contracts). Here's how it came together:

- üîß Tech Stack Solidity: HTLC smart contract deployed on an EVM. Handles ERC-20 token locking, claiming, and refunds.

- Move (Sui): HTLC module deployed on Sui testnet. Handles Coin<T> deposits with similar hashlock/timelock logic.

- Next.js: Used for the frontend interface and to build the off-chain relayer service.

- TypeScript: For the relayer logic to listen to events on both chains.

- Ethers.js: To interact with the EVM chain.

- Sui SDK (TypeScript): For interacting with the Sui chain and reading on-chain objects.

- Keccak256 hashing: Used consistently to derive the same preimage hash on both sides.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: 
  - EVM: ethers
  - SUI: @mysten/sui
  - 1inch: @1inch/cross-chain-sdk
